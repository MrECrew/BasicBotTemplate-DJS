# BasicBotTemplate-DJS
A basic template for a djs bot using the command handler system, contains testing / cmds.

### Setup
Change the stuff in config to info from the dev portal.
Change the log channel for restarts in index, also change the status.

### Creating Commands
Make your command in the commands folder then run "node dp" or whatever you called your deploy file.
Usually I restart the bot but they should appear soon enouth.
